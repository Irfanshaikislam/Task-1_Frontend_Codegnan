        Hardik Pandya was born on 11 October 1993 in Choryasi, Surat, Gujarat. His father, Himanshu Pandya, ran a small car finance business in Surat which he shut down and moved to Vadodara when Hardik was five to provide his sons with better cricket training facilities. Himanshu Pandya worked as a loan consultant in Vadodara<sup>.[3] </sup>He enrolled his two sons into Kiran More's cricket academy in Vadodara<sup>.[4] </sup>Lacking finances, the Pandya family lived in a rented apartment in Gorwa, with the brothers using a second-hand car to travel to the cricket ground<sup>.[3] </sup>Hardik studied at the MK High School until ninth grade before dropping out to focus on cricket<sup>.[5]</sup>
Hardik made steady progress in junior-level cricket, and according to Krunal, "won a lot of matches single-handedly" in club cricket<sup>.[4]</sup>In an interview with the Indian Express, Hardik said that he was dropped from his state age-group teams due to his "attitude problems". He added that he was "just an expressive child" who did not "like to hide his emotions<sup>."[6]</sup>

According to his father, Hardik was a leg spinner until the age of 18 and turned to fast bowling at the insistence of the Baroda coach Sanath Kumar<sup>.[7]</sup>

He also proclaimed that he likes to "observe how women move" at high-end bars and nightclubs, as well as on social media and then went on to liken himself to a black person saying, "I'm a little from the black side so I need to see how they move".[36][37][38] The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) sought legal action into the matter as it was a breach of conduct.[39][40] Both Pandya and Rahul were handed a suspension until a pending investigation and were called back from the ongoing tours of Australia and New Zealand.[41][38][42] Furthermore, on 13 January 2019, Gillette suspended their brand association with Pandya for its Mach3 razor.[43] On 24 January 2019, after lifting the suspension on Pandya and Rahul, the BCCI announced that Pandya would re-join the squad for the matches in New Zealand.[44]
